# Code Refactoring Skill

Incremental, safe refactoring using SOLID principles and design patterns.

## When to Refactor
- **Rule of 3**: Third time you see duplication → extract
- **Code smells**: Long method, large class, feature envy, data clumps
- **Before adding features**: Clean the area first
- **During code review**: When reviewer suggests improvement

## Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Method
```python
# Before
def process_order(order):
    # 50 lines of validation, calculation, persistence
    
# After
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    totals = calculate_totals(order)
    persist_order(order, totals)

def validate_order(order): ...
def calculate_totals(order): ...
def persist_order(order, totals): ...
```

### Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
```python
# Before
def shipping_cost(order):
    if order.type == 'express': return 20
    elif order.type == 'standard': return 10
    
# After
class ShippingStrategy: cost(self, order)
class ExpressShipping(ShippingStrategy): ...
class StandardShipping(ShippingStrategy): ...
```

### Introduce Parameter Object
```python
# Before
def create_user(name, email, phone, address, city, zip, country): ...

# After
@dataclass
class UserData:
    name: str
    email: str
    contact: ContactInfo  # phone, address grouped
    
def create_user(data: UserData): ...
```

### Replace Inheritance with Delegation
```python
# Before
class Stack extends ArrayList: ...

# After
class Stack:
    def __init__(self): self._items = []
    def push(self, item): self._items.append(item)
    def pop(self): return self._items.pop()
```

## Safe Refactoring Workflow

1. **Ensure tests pass** (run full suite)
2. **Small steps**: One refactoring at a time
3. **Run tests after each step**
4. **Commit after green** (separate refactor commits)
5. **Use IDE refactoring tools** when available

## Anti-Patterns to Fix

| Smell | Refactoring |
|-------|-------------|
| Long Method | Extract Method |
| Large Class | Extract Class |
| Duplicate Code | Extract Method/Class |
| Long Parameter List | Parameter Object |
| Feature Envy | Move Method |
| Data Clumps | Extract Class |
| Switch Statements | Polymorphism |
| Lazy Class | Inline Class |
| Speculative Generality | YAGNI - Delete |

## Tools Integration

### MCP Servers
- `refactor-mcp`: Regex-based search/replace with preview
- `ruff-mcp`: Auto-fix linting issues
- `clean-code`: Principles reference

### Commands
- `/careful-review` — Verify refactoring didn't break behavior
- `/find-missing-tests` — Ensure coverage after extraction

## Skill Invocation

Auto-invoked when:
- Agent detects code smells during implementation
- User requests `/clean` command
- Code review suggests refactoring
- Technical debt identified

**Output**: Step-by-step refactor plan with before/after diffs
